# Guild Wars Reforge Quest Tracker

## Version: 1.0.1 (The "Legendary Defender" Update)

Created by: Akito

A modern, minimalist desktop application designed to help Guild Wars players track their progress across all major campaigns, including the new **Legendary Defender of Ascalon (LDoA)** achievement path.

The interface follows a clean, modern Dark UI/UX theme and runs entirely as a local executable.

Yes, there is an install warning, all files are safe. Feel free to check them all out. Don't have a hundred to fork over to Windows for a Certificate.

### New Features in v1.0.1

* **Multi-Profile Support:** Track progress for **multiple characters or accounts** separately. All quest progress is saved and loaded per character profile.
* **Legendary Defender of Ascalon (LDoA) Tracker:** Dedicated section to track LDoA milestones, including leveling goals and daily Vanguard quests.
* **Tri-State Quest Tracking:** Mark quests as **Not Started** (Empty), **In Progress** (Green, Italic), or **Completed** (Gold, Strikethrough).
* **Intelligent Quest Grouping:** Side quests scraped from the wiki are now automatically **grouped by their starting location** for better organization.
* **Integrated Wiki Viewer with Dark Mode:** Loads quest details directly into the rounded right panel. Features custom CSS to provide a clean, focused **dark reading experience** without sidebars or clutter.
* **Global Search & Filters:** Search across all campaigns simultaneously and filter quests by **Status** (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
* **Time Tracking:** Records and displays the exact date/time of completion when a finished quest is selected.
* **Real-Time Data Sync:** Synchronizes and updates quest lists against the official Guild Wars Wiki in a non-blocking background thread.

### Download and Installation (Windows EXE)

The easiest way to use the tracker is by downloading the standalone executable:

1.  **Download:** Download the latest `GWReforgeTracker.exe` file from the **Releases page** at [https://github.com/Mr-Akito/GWReforgeTracker/releases](https://github.com/Mr-Akito/GWReforgeTracker/releases).
2.  **Run:** Place the executable in any folder and run it. The application automatically creates `gw1_data.db` and `gw1_cache.db` files to store your quest lists and progress locally.

### Building from Source

If you want to run the Python source code or build the executable yourself (requires Python 3.10+ and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`):

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mr-Akito/GWReforgeTracker/](https://github.com/Mr-Akito/GWReforgeTracker/)
    cd GWReforgeTracker
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    * **Tip:** You can launch a specific profile directly: `python main.py --profile "MyWarrior"`
4.  **Create the EXE (using PyInstaller):**
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon "GW_Icon.ico" --name "GWReforgeTracker" main.py
    ```
    *(Note: This command assumes your icon file `GW_Icon.ico` is in the root directory alongside `main.py`.)*
